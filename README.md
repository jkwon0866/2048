# 2048 in Terminal
## How to Use:
### Running the program:
1. Run `git clone https://github.com/jkwon0866/2048.git` and enter the directory. Alternatively, you can copy the main.cpp file into your own directory.
2. Compile the cpp file. If you are running a Unix system, you should be able to run `g++ main.cpp`
3. Call `./a.out` or the alternative name you gave the program. The ./ is the current directory.
### Playing the game:
For anyone new to 2048, the goal of the game is to reach 2048 by combining two like numbers adjacent to one another. A new number will fill up a spot in the grid with each slide you take. If all the grid spots fill up without any possibility of moving, you lose. If you reach 2048, you win!
1. Type the direction you want to go. You can either type all lowercase or the first letter as uppercase.
2. Have fun!
3. If you get tired of playing, you can just Ctrl + C.
